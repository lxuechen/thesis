\subsection{Derivation of the Frobenius norm identity} \label{app:frobenius}
Recall $a \in \R^{B\times T \times d}$ is the input to a linear layer with weight matrix $W \in \R^{p \times d}$, and $g \in \R^{B \times T \times p}$ is the gradient of the loss w.r.t. the output. The identity follows from trivial algebra:
\eqn{
\normf{ \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_i }^2 = \normf{ g_i^\top a_i }^2
&= \normf{ \sum_{k=1}^T g_{i, k} a_{i, k}^\top }^2 \\
&=
    \sum_{r=1}^d \sum_{s=1}^p \bracks{
        \sum_{k=1}^T a_{i, k, r} g_{i, k, s}
    }^2 \\
&=
    \sum_{r=1}^d \sum_{s=1}^p \sum_{k_1=1}^T \sum_{k_2=1}^T 
        a_{i, k_1, r} g_{i, k_1, s}
        a_{i, k_2, r} g_{i, k_2, s} \\
&=
    \sum_{k_1=1}^T \sum_{k_2=1}^T
        \bracks{ \sum_{r=1}^d a_{i, k_1, r} a_{i, k_2, r} }
        \bracks{ \sum_{s=1}^p g_{i, k_1, s} g_{i, k_2, s} } \\
&=
    \mathrm{vec}(a_{i} a_{i}^\top)^\top \mathrm{vec}( g_i g_i^\top ). 
}
Note that when $T=1$, the identity takes the form of 
\eqn{
\normf{ \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_i }^2
= 
    \mathrm{vec}(a_{i} a_{i}^\top)^\top \mathrm{vec}( g_i g_i^\top )
= 
    \normtwo{a_i}^2 \normtwo{g_i}^2. 
}
This is the \cite{goodfellow2015efficient} trick.

\subsection{Experiment Details}\label{app:experiments_main}

\paragraph{Sentence Classification.}
Results for RGP in Table~\ref{table:glue} are taken from documented numbers in their released codebase.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dayu11/Differentially-Private-Deep-Learning/tree/main/language}}
These results are under the DP guarantees of $(\epsilon, \delta)=(3, 10^{-5})$ or $(\epsilon, \delta)=(8, 10^{-5})$.
These guarantees are strictly looser than our guarantees which are based on $\delta=\nicefrac{1}{2 |\D_\text{train}|}$ (recall the smallest dataset in this cohort of tasks has $60$k+ records).
The RGP numbers in Table~~\ref{table:glue} are higher than those reported in their paper~\citep{yu2021large}, since the latter numbers are not based on fine-tuning the official RoBERTa models.

\paragraph{Table-To-Text Generation.}
To evaluate models trained on E2E and DART, we evaluate generations from models obtained with beam search with a beam size of $5$.
For evaluation, we run the official pipeline for E2E,\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tuetschek/e2e-metrics}} and the pipeline used in the GEM benchmark~\citep{gehrmann2021gem} for DART.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/GEM-metrics}}

\paragraph{Chit-Chat Dialog Generation.}
We built off Huggingface's codebase of the winning entry of the ConvAI2 competition,
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai}}
\footnote{\url{http://convai.io/2018/}} and used their preprocessed training set with the minor modification of truncating the number of training examples to be a multiple of the batch size.
The original ConvAI2 competition is aimed at advancing research on building engaging chatbots and also requested models to predict the mostly likely response given a list of candidates.
The challenge included hits@1 as part of its suite of automatic metrics.
For simplicity, we skip this step of predicting the most likely response for both training and evaluation. 
Results for the entry HuggingFace (ConvAI2 winner) in Table~\ref{table:personachat} are taken from the official validation set leader board.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DeepPavlov/convai/blob/master/leaderboards.md}}
Our reimplementation of HuggingFace's submission uses the released code for their winning entry, fine-tunes GPT with the default hyperparameters, and removes the classification loss for learning to predict the most likely response given candidates.

We additionally fine-tuned DialoGPT-medium~\citep{zhang2019dialogpt}, since the model was pretrained on conversation-like exchanges extracted from Reddit comment chains. Intuitively, this pretraining corpus is more aligned with the downstream fine-tuning data than WebText~\citep{radford2019language}, and thus would likely improve downstream performance.

To evaluate the F1 score, we obtained predicted responses from trained models using beam search with a beam size of $5$.
Since past work found that the F1 score can be gamed by always letting the model predict a predetermined phrase~\citep{dinan2019second}, we additionally ask humans to rate generations from the model through Amazon mechanical turk to obtain a more complete picture of model quality.
When sampling responses for human evaluation, we used nucleus sampling with $p=0.9$~\citep{holtzman2019curious}.
For human evaluation, we asked 20 turkers to each rate 5 entries.
For each entry, a turker is asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 the quality of predicted responses from privately fine-tuned DialoGPT-medium models, non-privately fine-tuned DialoGPT-medium models, non-privately fine-tuned GPT models (our reimplementation of HuggingFace's entry), and the reference text, given the history of the dialog. 
Since human evaluation can yield noisy results, we also report the $95\%$ asymptotic confidence interval in Table~\ref{table:personachat}.
All models were trained and evaluated on the version of Persona-Chat with the original persona.
All numbers reported in Table~\ref{table:personachat} are obtained on the validation split.

\subsection{Subtleties of implementing DP mixed precision training}
\label{app:mixed_precision}
Mixed precision training~\citep{micikevicius2017mixed} accelerates updates by storing certain tensors in half-precision.
To mitigate negative effects caused by potential arithmetic underflow, usual implementations upscale the loss with an adaptive factor pre-backpropagation and downscale the gradients with the same factor post-backpropagation. 
The scaling factor is adapted based on whether underflow is observed during training.

Special care needs to be taken when combining gradient privatization with mixed precision training.
One implementation that ensures similar results across full and mixed precision training 
(1) upscales the loss with the adaptive factor $K$, (2) clips per-example gradients by $C K$, (3) adds to the sum of clipped gradients the usual Gaussian noise multiplied by $K$, and (4) downscales the noisy gradient by $K$.
This is the implementation that we adopt, and we were able to obtain similar results on the E2E dataset with and without mixed precision. 

One alternative implementation (a) upscales the loss with the adaptive factor $K$, (b) clips per-example gradients by $C$, (c) adds the usual Gaussian noise to the sum of clipped gradients, and (d) downscales noisy gradients by $K$. 
The main difference between this procedure and the prior is whether the factor $K$ is considered during clipping and noising.
This procedure, while having the same DP guarantee, typically does not result in similar results as full precision when the same hyperparameters are used across the two settings (even with an optimizer like Adam which self-adjusts the magnitude of updates with accumulated empirical second moments).
We also identified that this implementation is also the primary reason that a prior work's code does not produce good results with full fine-tuning using our near-optimal hyperparameters.\footnote{
    \url{https://github.com/dayu11/Differentially-Private-Deep-Learning}
}

\newpage
\subsection{Hyperparameter Search Ranges}\label{app:hp_search_range}
We compare different adaptation methods by reporting task specific metrics on the test split using hyperparameters that maximize validation BLEU on E2E.
For sentence classification tasks, we reused the same hyperparameters, except for the number of training epochs and batch size.
For SST-2, we reused the same batch size as for private E2E fine-tuning, and the number of epochs exactly as in typical non-private fine-tuning for SST-2 (number of epochs equals to 3 in this case).
For remaining classification tasks, we use a batch size such that the sampling rate is the same as for SST-2, and a number of training epochs that is roughly proportional to the dataset size.
Appendix~\ref{app:hp_transfer} outlines why we transfer the sampling rate as opposed to the batch size.
We list the range of hyperparameters that we searched over for each individual adaptation method on E2E considered in the paper. 
Prefix-tuning has two additional hyperparameters: the length of the prefix and the dimensionality of the hidden layer. 
We set these to the default used by~\cite{li2021prefix} (10 for the former and 512 for the latter).
For Adam, we use the default hyperparamaters set by PyTorch~\citep{paszke2017automatic}.

\subsection{Additional Experiments on Run Time}
\label{app:runtime}

We include additional experiments comparing the run time of different clipping approaches.
Our goal is to further consolidate the claims that 1) adaptive per-layer clipping attains similar or better task performances under the same epoch budget for certain workflows, and that 2) this translates into compute time savings since per-layer clipping is faster than alternative clipping approaches per update (or almost equivalently per epoch).
All experiments here are performed on a machine with a single Titan RTX GPU with 24 GB of VRAM (different from the configuration in Figure~\ref{fig:throughput-comparison} which uses a single A6000 GPU).

The direct experiment we perform is to full fine-tune GPT-2 on E2E with three clipping approaches (adaptive per-layer, ghost, and flat clipping) under the same epoch constraint (which we fix to be 10 for all workflows).
Regarding hyperparameters for flat clipping, we adopt the set of values obtained from extensive tuning on this task used by~\cite{li2022large}.
We reuse the same set of hyperparameters values for ghost clipping, since the approach essentially results in the same gradient updates as flat clipping up to numerical precision (only computed in a different way).
Using these near optimal hyperparameters for flat and ghost clipping prevents our experiments from unfairly disfavouring the two approaches.
Figure~\ref{fig:gpt2runtime-overall-nll} shows that adaptive per-layer clipping consistently achieves lower test set negative log-likelihood than flat clipping and ghost clipping under any given wall time elapse.
While language generation metrics (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE-L) are generally noiser than the test set NLL, Figure~\ref{fig:gpt2runtime-overall-task-metric} shows that adaptive per-layer clipping generally yields better task metric numbers compared to flat clipping and ghost clipping under the same wall time.

Finally, we note the caveat that the precise run time advantage of adaptive per-layer clipping against flat clipping may vary across machines and GPU types.
In addition, the realized gains for actual training workflows might be smaller than that observed in our controlled experiments (e.g., Figure~\ref{fig:throughput-comparison}) due to compute time spent on auxiliary operations such as data loading and data preprocessing (e.g., pad sequences of different length to the same length). 
For instance, we repeat the controlled experiment in Figure~\ref{fig:throughput-comparison} but this time with a different GPU, and observe slightly different factors of speed gains. 
Overall, we generally see that adaptive per-layer clipping is above 1.4x the speed of flat clipping in our controlled experiments, and the realized gains is roughly as much for full fine-tuning on E2E with our implementation.

\subsection{Per-device Clipping and Experiments with GPT-3}\label{app:per_device_clipping}

\subsubsection{Additional Comments on Per-device Clipping}
Algorithm~\ref{alg:perdevice} details the private pipeline parallel training procedure with per-device clipping covered in the main text.
The algorithm adopts the equal budget noise allocation strategy to avoid incurring extra communication across devices.
For simplicity, the pseudocode covers a single update and omits any subprocedures for adapting clipping thresholds. 
Extending this pseudocode to adaptive threshold clipping based on quantile estimation is straightforward. 
Lastly, the pseudocode assumes that the model has already been partitioned into chunks of consecutive layers, where each chunk $\vtheta_k$ is hosted on device $k$. 

\begin{algorithm}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\State \textbf{INPUT}:  
Minibatch $\mathcal{S}$; 
iterate $\vtheta$; 
per-device parameters $\{\vtheta_1, \cdots, \vtheta_K\}$ hosted on $K$ devices;  
clipping thresholds $\{C_1,\dots, C_K\}$; 
noise multiplier $\sigma$; 
learning rate $\eta$; 
number of microbatches per minibatch $J$

\State Partition minibatch $\mathcal{S}$ into $J$ microbatches $\{ \mathcal{S}_1, \cdots, \mathcal{S}_J \}$

\State Create an empty execution schedule $\mathcal{C}$ 

\For{$j = 1$ to $J$}

\State Stage microbatch $\mathcal{S}_j$'s $\texttt{LocalForward}$ and $\texttt{LocalBackward}$ calls in the schedule $\mathcal{C}$, ensuring the stages are executed sequentially for this microbatch
\EndFor

\State Organize the schedule $\mathcal{C}$ based on pipeline parallel rules, allowing different devices to process different microbatches simultaneously

\State Execute the schedule $\mathcal{C}$

\State Synchronize all devices

\For{$k = 1$ to $K$}
\State $\vtheta_k' \gets \vtheta_k -{\eta} u_k $.
\EndFor

\State \textbf{return} $\vtheta' = (\vtheta_1', \cdots, \vtheta_K') $

    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State \textbf{INPUT}: Device id $k$; microbatch index $j$ 
        \State Wait for activations $a_{k-1}^{(j)}$ from device $k-1$ if $k > 1$; otherwise transfer microbatch $\mathcal{S}_j$ onto device $k$
        \State Perform forward pass with $a_{k-1}^{(j)}$ and model piece $\vtheta_i$ (stored on device $k$) to obtain outputs $a_{k}^{(j)}$

        \State Communicate activations $a_{k}^{(j)}$ to device $k+1$ if $k < K$

        \State Wait for output gradients $o_{k}^{(j)}$ if device $k < K$
        \State Rematerialize activations by performing extra forward pass
        \State Clip and sum per-example gradients $\{ \tilde{\vg}_k^{(i)} \}_i$ of local model piece $\vtheta_k$ by backpropagating based on $o_{k}^{(j)}$ or the loss values with threshold $C_k$; add this to a local accumulator $u_k$ (stored on device $k$)
        \State If $j=1$, add noise to accumulator $u_k$ to guarantee DP
        \State Compute gradients with respect to input $o_{k-1}^{(j)}$ and communicate this to device $k-1$ if $k > 1$.

\subsubsection{Fine-tuning GPT-3 on SAMSum}
Note the term ``GPT-3'' in the literature is used on multiple occasions and can refer to multiple models. 
Our experiments are based on fine-tuning or prompting the original GPT-3 model~\citep{brown2020language} and not the more recent variants which had been fine-tuned or adapted in some way (e.g., instruct-GPT-3~\citep{ouyang2022training} labeled with prefix \texttt{instruct-} in OpenAI API). 


Larger models are known to have better fine-tuned performance when inputs and outputs are formatted as instructions and responses~\citep{wei2021finetuned,sanh2021multitask}. 
We observed similar results when fine-tuning with differential privacy, and thus augmented the training and test sets by prepending the inputs with the instruction ``Summarize the following dialogue'' and the outputs with the delimiter ``TL;DR''. 
To ensure a fair comparison, we used this instruction-augmented dataset for all experiments. 

For decoding from models, we used beam search with a beam size of 4 for both GPT-3 and GPT-2-xl (including in-context learning experiments). 

To ensure we account for the variability in performance with different prompts for in-context learning, we sampled 3 sets of prompts for the 4-shot learning experiments and reported the average metric over runs. 

Without access to the original pretraining corpus, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of data contamination, which refers to the unfortunate outcome that parts of the fine-tuning or evaluation data occur in the pretraining corpus.
Nevertheless, we believe the chances of this happening are small due to two reasons. 
First, zero-shot prompting GPT-3 with both low temperature sampling and beam search based on instruction-augmented inputs tended to result in completions which either repeated or extended the instruction or the dialog (e.g., ``the following is a dialog between...''), or attempted to continue the dialog but digressed. 
In the limited number of examples we inspected, we were unable to find an instance where the output looked similar to a high-quality summary. Second, we looked up the initial time when the SAMSum paper was released to arXiv (late Nov. 2019). 
Given that the GPT-3 model we based our experiments off were pretrained with shards of Common Crawl uploaded (possibly) at the end of 2019~\citep{brown2020language}, we performed simple searches of the SAMSum paper with their url index in the Dec. 2019 crawl archive of Common Crawl and were not able to find the link of the paper.
Notably the SAMSum dataset was crafted by linguists and highly curated (as opposed to collected based on web data). 

For fine-tuning GPT-3 with DP LoRA on SAMSum, we reused hyperparameters adopted by~\cite{hu2021lora}, but re-tuned the learning rate based on preliminary runs for another dataset.
We set all per-device clipping threshold to be 1e-5 and adopted the equal budget noise allocation strategy for simplicity. 
We fine-tuned for 5 epochs in all runs (both GPT-3 and GPT-2-xl; both private and non-private).

For the DP LoRA fine-tuning runs, we used a machine with 16 V100 GPUs each with 32 gigabytes of VRAM. 
This enabled LoRA fine-tuning with a rank of 32 with a microbatch size of 1 under pipeline parallelism.
Fine-tuning with DP LoRA for 5 epochs on SAMSum's training set took 15 hours, and decoding with test inputs using beam search further took another 22 hours.

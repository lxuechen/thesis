\section{Additional Experiments Comparing Adaptive Per-layer Against Flat Clipping}
\label{app:glue_controlled_complementary}

This section complements the results in Table~\ref{table:glue_epoch_sst_2} and follows the same experimental protocol for those experiments except now we consider $\epsilon=8$. 
The goal is to provide further evidence showing that adaptive per-layer clipping has a privacy-utility tradeoff that is comparable to flat clipping when both methods are used to train models for the same number of training epochs. 


Table~\ref{table:glue_epoch_sst_2_complementary} shows that for full fine-tuning and across the epoch constraints we considered, adaptive per-layer clipping is competitive with flat clipping in terms of accuracy for different privacy budgets.
Note the results we obtain for flat clipping in Table~\ref{table:glue_epoch_sst_2_complementary} are higher than those reported by~\cite{li2022large}.
This is because to ensure that we are not unfairly disfavouring flat clipping for this  SST-2 task, we tuned hyperparameters on this task (details in Appendix~\ref{app:glue}); recall~\cite{li2022does} didn't tune on SST-2, but instead relied on hyperparameter transfer from the E2E task.

Adaptive per-layer clipping matches or outperforms flat clipping in accuracy (\%) on SST-2 under fixed epoch ($E$) constraints. 
This experiment performs full fine-tuning with both clipping approaches.
Numbers in parentheses are standard deviations from three independent runs.

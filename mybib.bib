abstract = {The problem of minimizing the root of a quadratic functional, subject to a system of affine constraints, occurs in investment portfolio selection, insurance risk theory, tomography, and other areas. We provide a solution that improves on the current published solution by being considerably simpler in computational terms. In particular, a succession of partitions and inversions of large matrices is avoided. Our solution method employs the Lagrangian multiplier method and we give two proofs, one of which is based on the solution of a related convex optimization problem. A geometrically intuitive interpretation of the objective function and of the optimization solution is also given.}

  abstract =   {We revisit the problem of differentially private release of classification queries. In this problem, the goal is to design an algorithm that can accurately answer a sequence of classification queries based on a private training set while ensuring differential privacy. We formally study this problem in the agnostic PAC model and derive a new upper bound on the private sample complexity. Our results improve over those obtained in a recent work (Bassily et al., 2018) for the agnostic PAC setting. In particular, we give an improved construction that yields a tighter upper bound on the sample complexity. Moreover, unlike (Bassily et al., 2018), our accuracy guarantee does not involve any blow-up in the approximation error associated with the given hypothesis class. Given any hypothesis class with VC-dimension $d$, we show that our construction can privately answer up to $m$ classification queries with average excess error $\alpha$ using a private sample of size $\approx \frac{d}{\alpha^2}\,\max\left(1, \sqrt{m}\,\alpha^{3/2}\right)$. Using recent results on private learning with auxiliary public data, we extend our construction to show that one can privately answer any number of classification queries with average excess error $\alpha$ using a private sample of size $\approx \frac{d}{\alpha^2}\,\max\left(1, \sqrt{d}\,\alpha\right)$. When $\alpha=O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$, our private sample complexity bound is essentially optimal.}

In this problem, the goal is to answer a large class $\mathcal{H}$ of statistical queries with error no more than $\alpha$ using a combination of public and private samples. The algorithm is required to satisfy differential privacy only with respect to the private samples. We study the limits of this task in terms of the private and public sample complexities. Our upper and lower bounds on the private sample complexity have matching dependence on the dual VC-dimension of $\mathcal{H}$. For a large category of query classes, our bounds on the public sample complexity have matching dependence on $\alpha$.}

  abstract =   {Stochastic convex optimization over an $\ell_1$-bounded domain is ubiquitous in machine learning applications such as LASSO but remains poorly understood when learning with differential privacy. We show that, up to logarithmic factors the optimal excess population loss of any $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private optimizer is $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \sqrt{d}/\epsilon n.$ The upper bound is based on a new algorithm that combines the iterative localization approach of Feldman et al. (2020) with a new analysis of private regularized mirror descent. It applies to $\ell_p$ bounded domains for $p\in [1,2]$ and queries at most $n^{3/2}$ gradients improving over the best previously known algorithm for the $\ell_2$ case which needs $n^2$ gradients. Further, we show that when the loss functions satisfy additional smoothness assumptions, the excess loss is upper bounded (up to logarithmic factors) by $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + (\log(d)/\epsilon n)^{2/3}.$ This bound is achieved by a new variance-reduced version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm that requires just a single pass over the data. We also show that the lower bound in this case is the minimum of the two rates mentioned above.}

  abstract =   {We revisit the problem of empirical risk minimziation (ERM) with differential privacy. We show that noisy AdaGrad, given appropriate knowledge and conditions on the subspace from which gradients can be drawn, achieves a regret comparable to traditional AdaGrad plus a well-controlled term due to noise. We show a convergence rate of $O(\tr(G_T)/T)$, where $G_T$ captures the geometry of the gradient subspace. Since $\tr(G_T)=O(\sqrt{T})$ we can obtain faster rates for convex and Lipschitz functions, compared to the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate achieved by known versions of noisy (stochastic) gradient descent with comparable noise variance. In particular, we show that if the gradients lie in a known constant rank subspace, and assuming algorithmic access to an envelope which bounds decaying sensitivity, one can achieve faster convergence to an excess empirical risk of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon n)$, where $\epsilon$ is the privacy budget and $n$ the number of samples. Letting $p$ be the problem dimension, this result implies that, by running noisy Adagrad, we can bypass the DP-SGD bound $\tilde O(\sqrt{p}/\epsilon n)$ in $T=(\epsilon n)^{2/(1+2\alpha)}$ iterations, where $\alpha \geq 0$ is a parameter controlling gradient norm decay, instead of the rate achieved by SGD of $T=\epsilon^2n^2$. Our results operate with general convex functions in both constrained and unconstrained minimization.  Along the way, we do a perturbation analysis of noisy AdaGrad, which is of independent interest. Our utility guarantee for the private ERM problem follows as a corollary to the regret guarantee of noisy AdaGrad.}

  journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
  abstract = {Applications of quantum technology often require fidelities to quantify performance. These provide a fundamental yardstick for the comparison of two quantum states. While this is straightforward in the case of pure states, it is much more subtle for the more general case of mixed quantum states often found in practice. A large number of different proposals exist. In this review, we summarize the required properties of a quantum fidelity measure, and compare them, to determine which properties each of the different measures has. We show that there are large classes of measures that satisfy all the required properties of a fidelity measure, just as there are many norms of Hilbert space operators, and many measures of entropy. We compare these fidelities, with detailed proofs of their properties. We also summarize briefly the applications of these measures in teleportation, quantum memories and quantum computers, quantum communications, and quantum phase-space simulations.}

    abstract = "Privacy concerns have attracted increasing attention in data-driven products due to the tendency of machine learning models to memorize sensitive training data. Generating synthetic versions of such data with a formal privacy guarantee, such as differential privacy (DP), provides a promising path to mitigating these privacy concerns, but previous approaches in this direction have typically failed to produce synthetic data of high quality. In this work, we show that a simple and practical recipe in the text domain is effective: simply fine-tuning a pretrained generative language model with DP enables the model to generate useful synthetic text with strong privacy protection. Through extensive empirical analyses on both benchmark and private customer data, we demonstrate that our method produces synthetic text that is competitive in terms of utility with its non-private counterpart, meanwhile providing strong protection against potential privacy leakages.",

  abstract =   {Differential privacy is widely accepted as the de facto method for preventing data leakage in ML, and conventional wisdom suggests that it offers strong protection against privacy attacks. However, existing semantic guarantees for DP focus on membership inference, which may overestimate the adversary’s capabilities and is not applicable when membership status itself is non-sensitive. In this paper, we derive the first semantic guarantees for DP mechanisms against training data reconstruction attacks under a formal threat model. We show that two distinct privacy accounting methods—Renyi differential privacy and Fisher information leakage—both offer strong semantic protection against data reconstruction attacks.}
